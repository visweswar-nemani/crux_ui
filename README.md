# General Introduction about the Project :

Crux Bank UI is a bank web application where customers can access their accounts and perform any required steps like Money Transfer, Balance Check and Transaction History etc. Application was developed in an easy way of access to customers like starting with a welcome page where it has signup, login and forgot password options using which customers will get into the application and can perform different necessary actions from their respective account. After the necessary actions were done the customer can log out from the account.

Technologies In the CRUX Bank App the welcome page was designed and built using html,CSS,Java Script, React JS and React-Bootstrap. Home page was designed using nav bar, accordion and bootstrap components for dropdown. Backend API's where created using spring JPA ORM and HSQL in the database for storing data.

# Installation :
1)Download and install Node.js(version>=13.0) into your machine from https://nodejs.org/en/.
2)Clone the repository into your machine.
3) Navigate to the repository and enter script "npm init" in terminal/command prompt. This will install all the dependencies required for the project into your machine.
4) Now we can exectue below standard scripts to run/test/build the application.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
